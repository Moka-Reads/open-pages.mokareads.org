## Summary

Developing an optimization problem for determining optimal pricing strategies across several digital publishing platforms.

## Abstract

This research addresses the complex challenge of pricing digital content across multiple publishing platforms simultaneously. In today's digital publishing landscape, content creators must navigate varying platform fees, different audience demographics, and cross-platform cannibalization effects.

We propose a penalty-reward optimization framework that balances revenue maximization with market penetration goals. The model incorporates platform-specific constraints, demand elasticity, and competitive pricing dynamics to determine optimal price points that maximize total revenue while maintaining desired market presence across all platforms.
